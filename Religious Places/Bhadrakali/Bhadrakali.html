                Maa Bhadrakali temple is one of the 52 Shakti Peeths found in India. Origin of Shakti Peeths is an ancient story. Legends say that Goddess Sati married Lord
                Shiva against the will of her father, King Daksha. One day Daksha performed a Yagya where he invited all deities, but not his own daughter. Sati visited the
                ceremony unexpectedly, but with the permission of Lord Shiva. Being already infuriated by her, Daksha insulted her and her husband which she couldn't tolerate,
                and threw herself into the sacred yagya fire.

                Grief stricken Lord Shiva started pacing the universe with the dead body of Sati in his hands. This act of Shiva
                made the other Hindu Gods extremely worried and hence, Lord Vishnu released the Sudarshan Chakra that cut Sati's body into 52 parts, those parts fell on earth
                at different locations. Sati's right ankle was found in Kurukshetra. Presence of the Goddess's body part makes this place very blessed. It is believed that 
                visiting the temple on Saturday and worshipping the Goddess fulfils the wishes of devotees. After the fulfilment of one's wish, they are supposed to offer miniature
                horses to the temple.

                    The consort of Savitri is called Sthanu. Hence, the city is called Sthaneswar or Thanesar. Here the devotees offer 
                    terracotta horse that is a mud horse, to the deity for having their wishes fulfilled. You will find various horse 
                    idols in the center of the Mandir Verandah facing the lotus in the center. The devotees feel sanctified after coming 
                    here and they force themselves to come again to the shrine as the serene helps the mind to relax.

            It is also believed that Pandavas along with Lord Krishna worshipped Ma Durga and after the victory in Mahabharata battle, they came here again to worship Mother 
            Goddesses. They also offered their horses in her service. Since that day, the devotees offer terracotta and metal horses to the deity after their wishes are fulfilled.
            It is also believed that 'mundan' (hair removing) ceremony of Shri Krishna and Balaram was performed in this temple.
