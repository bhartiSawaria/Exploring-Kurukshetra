                        Birla Mandir, as the name suggests, was built by the reputed philanthropist of the Birla clan, late Jugal Birla, in the year 1952. 
                        The renovation of the old temples and the construction of the new tourist destinations came about much after the Birla Temple was 
                        built here. For quite a long time, therefore, it remained one of the few major tourist attractions of Kurukshetra since its inception. 
                        It is built on the periphery of the old city on Kurukshetraâ€“Thanesar road, quite close to Brahm Sarovar and approximately 2.5 
                        kilometres from the railway station.

                        Birla Temple is made of pure marble and has a lush garden on its back side. The main complex houses the famous sculpture of 
                        Lord Krishna standing on a chariot harnessed with horses on the battleground of Mahabharata and delivering divine sermon of 
                        Bhagavad Gita to the awe-struck Arjun crouching on the ground with folded hands listening with rapt attention.
