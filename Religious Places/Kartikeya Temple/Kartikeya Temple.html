                Kartikeya Temple in Pehowa town of Haryana is an ancient temple which dates back to the 5th century B.C. Kartikeya is a Hindu 
                deity and is worshiped widely across the country.

                The temple has two rock 
                blocks and a marble image of Lord Kartikeya flanked by two oil lamps. The oil is offered to the stone blocks, the marble image, 
                and the lamps. The temple would be at least 4500 years old.

                As per the Skanda Purana Lord Shiva wed Sati who was the grand-daughter of Lord Brahma and the daughter of king Daksha. He 
                never liked Lord Shiva. Daksha insulted Lord Shiva during a Yagna ceremony. Hence, Sati immolated herself in anger over the 
                insult of her husband. When Lord Shiva came to know about this incidence he got angry. The Yagna was destroyed by the gana 
                army of Lord Shiva led by Virabhadra.<!--Meanwhile, Demon Taraka believed that his boon of being killed by Lord Shiva's son would 
                give him invincibility as Lord Shiva will not get married again. Hence, devtas manage to get Lord Shiva remarried to Goddess 
                Parvati with the help of The Kama, the God of love who awake Lord Shiva from his penance, incurring his wrath in the process.-->

                Lord Shiva handed over the radiance of his third eye to Agni, as he believed that Agni alone was able of handling it until it 
                becomes the desired offspring. Agni, tortured by its heat, handed it over to Goddess Ganga who in turn put it in a lake amidst                     a forest of reeds. The child was finally born in this forest with six faces. He was first spotted and cared by six women 
               representing the Pleiades - Kritika. He thus got named Karttikeya. As a young lad, he killed demon Taraka. Lord Kartikeya is 
                also known as Kumar.

                According to another legend, Lord Krishna asked Yudhishthira to light two lamps for the 18 lakh warriors who died in the 
                Mahabharata battle. These lamps flank the temple and it is believed that they have been continuously lit since then. The 
                temple of Lord Kartikeya stands at the site where Lord Kartikay removed his skin and left it with Goddess Parvati as he had 
                doubt that his mother helped Ganesha to complete the Trilok parikrama. After giving up his skin he came to Pehowa temple and 
                said that no women can enter in this temple. This temple celebrates Brahmachari form of Lord Kartikeya. Hence, women 
                are strictly forbidden in this temple. The devotees observe strict rules during Chaturmas.
