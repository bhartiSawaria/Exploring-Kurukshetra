                The Pathar Masjid noted for its fluted minarets attached to its back wall is built of red sandstone. The ceiling of the 
                mosque resting on pillars is decorated with floral designs carved in low relief. The pillars are also profusely 
                decorated with floral designs, while the bases over the mouldings show 'chaitya'-window motifs. As its name suggests the 
                structure of Pathar Ki Masjid in Patna is built of stones.
