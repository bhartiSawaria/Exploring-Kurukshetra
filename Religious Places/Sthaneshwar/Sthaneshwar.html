                        Shthaneshwar Mahadev Temple is more than 5000 years old. It's dedicated to Lord Shiva and holds immense mythological and historical 
                        importance. As per the legend,
                        Lord Brahma laid the first lingam of Lord Shiva here and hence, he was first worshipped in this temple only. Mahashivratri, the             Hindu festival dedicated to Lord
                        Shiva, is celebrated in this temple with grandeur. Pandavas along with Lord Krishna visited this temple to worship Lord Shiva to 
                        seek his blessings for their 
                        victory in the war of Mahabharata.

                            of temple, and people believe that its holy water has high healing powers. A big blue beautiful idol of Lord Shiva resting on 
                            a stone slab stands in the middle
                            of the pond.

                            In the past, King 
                            Ban's leprosy was cured when he took a dip in this holy water. Guru Tegh Bahadur Singh, who was the 9th Sikh guru, also stayed 
                            in this temple, which is also a 
                            reason that a Sikh Gurudwara was built next to this temple.

                        The temple houses a Shiva Linga which is ancient and still worshiped by locals. The temple has been renovated in recent times. 
                        Sthaneshwar Mahadev temple has a
                        white Amla dome-shaped roof along with a tall pinnacle which follows a regional type of architecture. A huge pond or lake is 
                        seen in front of the temple. A unique
                        feature of the Sthanshwar Mahadev is that the temple kitchen provides free lunch for the pilgrims. The temple provides free 
                        food for the hospital patients as well.
                        Any pilgrimage to Kurukshetra is considered incomplete without visiting this temple. 
                        It was here that the Pandavas along with Krishna prayed to Lord Shiva and received his blessings for victory in the battle of Mahabharata.
