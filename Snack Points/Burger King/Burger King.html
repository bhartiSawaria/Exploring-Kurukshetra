                        Burger King Corporation is the second largest fast-food chain in the United States, trailing only McDonald's. The company 
                        franchises more than 10,400 restaurants and owns about 1,000 for a chainwide total exceeding 11,455, with locations in all 50 
                        states and 56 countries. The company serves 15.7 million customers each day and over 2.4 billion Burger King hamburgers are 
                        sold each year across the globe. In the late 1990s and into the new millennium, Burger King was plagued by falling sales and 
                        deteriorating franchisee relationships. Burger King's parent, Diageo plc, sold the company to a group of investors led by 
                        Texas Pacific Group in late 2002.

                    Burger King Worldwide's focus is on franchising. About 99% of all Burger King locations are owned and operated by independent 
                    franchisees. Today, there are more than 13,000 Burger King restaurants in 91 countries and territories worldwide. In the third 
                    quarter, global comparable-store sales increased 0.9%. McDonald's posted a 0.9% rise as well. Wendy's doesn't report global sales, 
                    but in its North American segment, the company posted a 3.2% increase in comparable-store sales. Since almost all of Burger King's 
                    locations are franchised, the company has the highest margins among the three. Its gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 
                    45% beats both McDonald's and Wendy's. McDonald's has the lowest P/E ratio among the three at 17.
