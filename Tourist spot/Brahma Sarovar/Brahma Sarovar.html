                    Brahma Sarovar, as its name suggests, is a water tank in Thanesar in Haryana. It is considered sacred by Hindus and is incredibly 
                    beautiful. It is said that the water inside the tank is sacred and used by people internally as well as externally to take a bath 
                    and attain salvation. It has been currently renovated and equipped with modern state-of-the-art facilities. The tank has the 
                    dimensions of 3600 (length) and 1500 (breadth) having a rectangular shape. Brahma Sarovar is the most exquisite and breathtaking
                    site in Kurukshetra. Tourists can spend hours here watching the sunset with its reddish and golden reflection in the water.

                             Brahma Sarovar is one of Asia's largest man-made pond. It is 3600 ft long, 1500 ft broad and 45 ft deep. Brahma stands for Lord 
                             Brahma, the creator of universe in Hinduism, and Sarovar in Hindi means 'pond'. The pond is named such because myths say that 
                             Lord Brahma created the universe from the land of Kurukshetra.

                            Being sacred to Hinduism, the Brahma Sarovar is worshipped twice a day, at sunrise and sunset. There is also a beautiful temple 
                            that stands inside the water, accessible by a concrete bridge. A giant black stone chariot of Lord Krishna and Arjuna is located 
                            in its premises.

                            Brahma Sarovar also hosts Geeta Jayanti celebration every year, which is usually a seven days festival, to celebrate the birth of 
                            Bhagavad Geeta. Dance performances, dramas, competitions, social campaigns, exhibitions, sacred ceremonies, etc. are organized 
                            throughout the week.
