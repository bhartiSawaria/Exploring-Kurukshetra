            Situated about 12 km from Kurukshetra on Kurukshetra-Pehowa road, Jyotisar is an important place of religious tourism. The holy land of Jyotisar is believed
            to be the cradle of Hindu civilisation and culture. It is believed that Lord Krishna delivered the eternal message of Bhagwad Gita to Arjuna before 
            commencement of Mahabharata battle here.
            A light and sound show on the theme of Bhagwad Gita is also a worth an experience.
        </p>
        <p>

            Residents of this area believe that Lord Krishna delivered the Bhagwad Gita standing under a banyan tree at this place; millions of people come here to pay
            their obeisance to the celestial and eternal Gita. A central place of interest at Jyotisar is a captivating marble statue of Krishna on a beautiful chariot, 
            delivering the immortal Gita to Arjuna canopied by a banyan tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            One can also see lots of red coloured "holy wish threads" on the branches of this Banyan tree and other places, inside the temple. 
            The ritual of tying such wish threads is very common in Hinduism, especially in ancient and highly accomplished temples. Devotees tie the threads asking for
            a wish from their revered and when this wish is fulfilled, they come to untie the thread. After all, faith in such beliefs keeps this universe going, right?
