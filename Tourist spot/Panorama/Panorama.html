            of the epic battle of Kurukshetra that showcases Mahabharata war with scientific explanations justifying every episode in the war. The magnificent
            two-storied building of the Centre has cylindrical walls. The Centre has an interesting exhibition called 'India: A Heritage in Science, Technology and 
            Culture',consisting of working and interactive exhibits on ancient Indian concept of properties of matter, structure of atom, geometry, arithmetical rules, 
            astronomy, medicine and surgery.

                The tall and cylindrical building has elegant architecture and ambience. On the centre of the cylindrical hall, there are paintings 34-feet in 
                heightdepicting various episodes of Mahabharata from confrontation between the Pandavas and the Kauravas to the diorama of the battleground that epitomises 
                the carnage realistically.

            A Science Park has also been set up outside the Centre's building. It is a refreshing concept of science learning for children through fun and enjoyment. 
            Not only children but also adults get attracted to these aesthetically placed exhibits in the greenery of the park.
